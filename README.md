# open-annote

The Open Annote appilcation/project files should be opened via Eclipse IDE. The site to download Eclipse can be found at: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. After the installation is complete, open Eclipse and create a default directory for a workspace when prompted to do so (the path that is prepopulated will do). Then click 'Launch'. Eclipse will then open the workspace. When loading the project files, be sure to take note of the path they are in when they were downloaded from the GitHub repository. Then navigate, through Eclipse, to 'File' then 'Open Projects from File System...' then click 'Directory' to navigate to the Open Annote application folder where they can they be 'Opened' into the Eclipse IDE. 

After the application files are loaded, building and executing it can also be done via Eclipse. Navigate to the top menu bar within Eclipse and click on 'Run' (or the green button with a white arrow). Eclipse will then build and automatically open a Java application labeled 'GUI' where the Open Annote application will be visible and fully functional to the user.

If there are any questions related to setting up, building, and running the application, please feel free to reach out to the Open Annote team.
